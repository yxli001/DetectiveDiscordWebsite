# ExtermaHate

## Goal
Our goal for this project was to build a series of projects that would use our API help encourage internet saftey. To accomplish this, we built a Discord bot that would auto moderate Discord messages and also share bans across servers. We also built a tool which allows you to enter a website URL and get the saftey score of that website back. This would ensure kids/students could know what websites would contain explicit content before they visit them. We also created a tool which would allow you to see how explicit text you input is. This would ensure that none of the essays you write are offensive. This stops internet hate at its source
